## Rubric (MVP)

### Web Unit 2
* Student created functional components and used events in application to add dynamic functionality to app.
* Student's code was organized at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorporated and correctly implemented.  Student used Array methods to dynamically render HTML elements.
* Student implemented GET requests using either Axios or Fetch to display 3rd party data on a deployed page. Route management properly installed and used to show top level pages as well as nested views where necessary.
* Student has set up component management for the forms in the app that makes sense for each form. Student made the decision to use a third-party library, like Formik, or not, and can defend their decision. Some form validation is in place.

### Web Unit 3

* React application is deployed and the static landing page is correctly incorporated with the app.
* CRUD operations drive the application. Each participating student individually created pages that complete all CRUD operations. Token authentication is handled correctly.
* Student has implemented a state management system that makes sense for the project. It is organized well and implemented correctly. State is not lost as user goes through the application.
